# Smart Home Automation System

## Project Overview
A C++ application that simulates a Smart Home Automation and Energy Management System. This object-oriented system allows users to monitor and control various smart devices throughout a virtual home environment, while tracking energy usage and managing user access.

## Core Features
- **Device Management**: Control various smart devices (lights, thermostats, security cameras)
- **Room Control**: Organize and manage devices by room location
- **User Authentication**: Multi-level access system (HomeOwner, FamilyMember, Guest)
- **Energy Monitoring**: Track and analyze power consumption
- **Automated Scheduling**: Set up device routines and schedules

## Implementation
- Written in C++
- Demonstrates OOP principles:
  - Inheritance (Device hierarchies)
  - Polymorphism (Device behavior)
  - Encapsulation (Data protection)
  - Operator Overloading
  - Dynamic Memory Management
- Terminal-based user interface
- File-based data persistence

## Development Status
🚧 Currently under development as part of university coursework in Object-Oriented Programming.

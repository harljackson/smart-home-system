# 🏠 Smart Home Automation System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Home Automation System** is a **C++ application** that simulates a smart home environment with integrated **device control** and **energy management** functionality.  
Built using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, the system enables users to monitor and control multiple smart devices across a virtual home while tracking overall energy usage.

## ⚙️ Core Features

- 💡 **Device Management**  
  Control and manage smart devices including:
  - Lights  
  - Thermostats  
  - Security cameras  

- 🏠 **Room-Based Organisation**  
  Devices are grouped by room to reflect a realistic home layout.

- 📊 **Energy Monitoring**  
  Tracks and calculates energy consumption across connected devices.

- 🖥️ **Terminal-Based User Interface**  
  Interactive command-line interface for user input and system control.

## 🧠 Technical Implementation

- **Language:** C++
- **Programming Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Demonstrated Concepts
- 🧬 **Inheritance** – Structured device class hierarchies  
- 🔁 **Polymorphism** – Dynamic device behaviour through base-class interfaces  
- 🔒 **Encapsulation** – Controlled access to internal data  
- ➕ **Operator Overloading** – Custom object operations  
- 🧠 **Dynamic Memory Management** – Efficient handling of resources
